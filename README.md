# Markov Chain Simulation and Statistical Analysis

This project simulates a Markov chain and performs a detailed statistical analysis. It combines classical probability theory with machine learning techniques.

## Overview

- **Markov Chain Simulation:** Models a finite-state Markov chain with a customizable transition matrix.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Verifies the Central Limit Theorem through repeated experiments and provides key metrics like mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Uses logistic regression to estimate the transition matrix from simulated data.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Generates interactive plots using Plotly for a clear visual understanding of the results.
